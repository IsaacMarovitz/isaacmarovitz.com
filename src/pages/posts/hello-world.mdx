Starting a blog may seem like the most boring and basic thing that everyone and their mum has done, but I wanted to build for myself a platform to post longer-form content that would otherwise not fit on a site like Bluesky, or would be out of place for my regular postings.

Much of my online content recently has been purely about my work on [Marathon Recompiled](https://github.com/sonicnext-dev/MarathonRecomp), and while I'm having a lot of fun with that project there's still plenty else that goes on day-to-day that I otherwise don't really share for one reason or another. Whether it's political, or just a general rant about one project or another, regardless of if anyone ends up reading it, I want to be able to put it out into the world.

Such is the justification for this blog. Maybe I'll never use it, or maybe I'll starting posting regularly, but it's at least an option now.

See you 'round.
